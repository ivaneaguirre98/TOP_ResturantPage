## Challenges I Faced
Some challenges I faced on this project was the learning curve of using Webpack for the first time. This would be my first time using Webpack on this project so ensuring that it was all setup correctly was a bit of a challenge at first. 

Second, was working in modules as opposed to a single JS file. This was the first major project I worked on where I seperated each page into its own module and pulled it all together in the index.js file. So making sure I was importing the correct information and structuring my files correctly was a bit of a challenge.

While it was a challenge at first, I find seperating tasks into their own module allows for an easier time to troubleshoot any errors that arise and I know exactly where to look for the bugs.
